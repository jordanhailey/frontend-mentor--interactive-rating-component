## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

### Screen Capture

![My Solution](./my_solution.gif)
> **Screen Capture Description**: 
> 
> A GIF of my solution, where users can see that the number and submit buttons have distinct `hover` and `active` states. 
> 
> Upon clicking submit, the app hides the "Form" and shows the "Thank You" message. 
> 
> I also added a "Reset State" button to the page to allow the user to revert back to the default state.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### What I learned

Usibng utility classes when writing CSS is super handy, but they add a lot of mental overhead when jumping between HTML and CSS editing.

### Continued development

I'm a bit shakey when it comes to my CSS, and this was my first attempt at implementing the *CUBE CSS* methodology. I feel I didn't do a great job being consistent with using utility classes, this would be something I would like to improve upon.

The transition between views is also very basic (`display:none` -> `display:block` and vice versa), it might be nice to add a CSS animation of some sort to make the transition feel more natural.
